					<p class="mb-5">Backgammon is a two-player board game consisting of player's and opponents' "home" boards and "outer" boards. Each board is subdivided into six alternately colored triangles called "points". The home and outer boards are separated down the center by a partition called the "bar". 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">The points are numbered for either player starting in that player's home board. The outermost point is the twenty-four point, which is also the opponent's one point. Each player has fifteen checkers of his own color. The initial board arrangement of checkers is: two on each player's twenty-four point, five on each player's thirteen point, three on each player's eight point, and five on each player's six point. 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">The goal of backgammon is to move all player's checkers into his home board and then bear them off (i.e. remove them from the board). The first player to remove all of his checkers wins the game. 
					</p>
