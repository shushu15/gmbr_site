					<p class="mb-5">Cribbage is a two player game. The object of the Six-card cribabge game game is to be the first to score 121 points, which is the same as going around the board twice and then moving one more point. Five Card Cribbage is an older traditional version which is still popular in United Kingdom. 5-card Cribbage differs from the more modern 6 card cribbage by the number of cards in hand (initially 5) and by the score to play - usually it is 61 points. 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">The cribbage players use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank K(high)Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A (low). 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">A standard cribbage board has four parallel rows of 30 holes each, plus two pegs for each player. Two rows are used by each player; thus each player moves his or her pegs around a 60-hole track, advancing one hole for each point scored. Each player is given two pegs, one peg marking the player's current score and the other peg the player's previous score. Each time new points are earned, the players rear peg moves ahead of the forward peg as many holes as the number of points earned. By convention, players travel up the board's outer tracks and down the inner tracks, which means that one player moves around a track clockwise and the other moves anti-clockwise.
