					<p class="mb-5"A domino is a small tile that represents the roll of two dice. The tile, commonly called a bone, is rectangular with a line down the center. There are many dominoes game variations across the world.

					<p class="mb-5">There are 3 versions of online domino games: Five-Up (aka Muggins or All Fives) as well as Draw and Block. All-Fives is a scoring dominoes game, there you need to score tailing points, Draw and Block are the classical dominoes games of the blocking type.

Points may be awarded during the play of the hand by making the exposed ends of the chain total to a multiple of five (in Five-Up). The winner at the end of each hand also scores points for all the pips remaining in the other player's hand. Players can also select between 7-bone hand and 9-bone hand. There are many dominoes game options like using or not using spinner etc.
					</p>
