Points may be awarded during the play of the hand by making the exposed ends of the chain total to a multiple of five (in Five-Up). The winner at the end of each hand also scores points for all the pips remaining in the other player's hand. Players can also select between 7-bone hand and 9-bone hand. There are many dominoes game options like using or not using spinner etc.
