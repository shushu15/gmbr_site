					<p class="mb-5">Gin Rummy is a skill-based card game for two players. The game is played with one standard deck of 52 cards, each player is dealt 10 cards. The goal in Gin Rummy is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in the own hand, by melding them into sets and runs and laying them down. A "set" contains 3-4 cards of the same value, while a "run" consists of 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit. 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">The player begins a turn by drawing a card either from the stock or from discard piles, and adding it to the hand. To complete the turn, player discards a single card from the hand onto the discard pile. There are three ways to win a round of Gin rummy: Gin, Knock and Undercut. Gin - is when players meld all the cards in the own hand, knocking, discarding the last card and laying all melds down. Knock - is when a player melds all the cards in the hand and their deadwood count's total equals 10 or lower (see Oklahoma variation). Undercut - is when player's deadwood count is equal to the Knocker's or lower. 
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">A game consists of a series of hands, and it ends when a player accumulates 100 or more points. Then, the final scores are calculated and the player with the higher score is the winner.
